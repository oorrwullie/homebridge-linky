## 📋 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Linky, please report it **privately**.

**Do not open a public issue** — this helps protect users while a fix is developed.

Instead, please:

- Open a GitHub [Security Advisory](https://github.com/oorrwullie/homebridge-linky/security/advisories)
- Or, email us privately (if email is added later)

We will investigate the report promptly and coordinate a fix and disclosure.

## 🛡️ What Happens Next

Once a vulnerability is reported:

1. We will confirm the vulnerability and assess severity.
2. We will work on a fix or mitigation plan immediately.
3. A patched release will be issued as soon as possible.
4. Credit will be given if desired by the reporter.

We appreciate responsible disclosure efforts and thank security researchers for helping keep Linky safe!
