# v0.7.1 - Minor Improvements ðŸš€

This release includes a series of CI and workflow improvements to streamline our processes and enhance our project's performance. There are no user-facing changes in this version.

## Internal Improvements

- **Publish Workflow Updates:** We've made several modifications to our publish workflow. These changes include using Personal Access Tokens (PAT) to fix push permissions and ensuring the workflow only runs after successful CI on the main branch. This helps us maintain a high level of code quality and stability.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** We've added fallback mechanisms for both tags and release notes within our publish.yml. This ensures our publishing process remains smooth and uninterrupted, even if unexpected issues arise.

As always, we appreciate the contributions from our community and encourage you to continue helping us improve this project.
