Welcome to version 0.9.0 of our project. This version brings with it a number of improvements and enhancements that are set to improve the overall user experience. Here's what's new:

## Internal Improvements
- We've updated our publish workflow to use Personal Access Tokens (PAT) in order to fix push permissions. This is a significant step towards enhancing the security of our project and ensuring that we maintain the integrity of our codebase.

## Miscellaneous
- We've been working hard behind the scenes and have made several version bumps in our journey towards this release. These include bumps to version 0.8.0 and 0.7.1. These version updates were necessary to facilitate the introduction of new features and improvements.
