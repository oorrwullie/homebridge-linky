# v0.8.0 - New Release ðŸš€

We're excited to announce the release of version 0.8.0! This update includes improvements to our publishing workflow and other internal enhancements. Here are the details:

## Internal Improvements

- **Updated Publish Workflow**: We've updated our publish workflow to use Personal Access Tokens (PAT) and fixed push permissions. This will help streamline our release process and ensure that we can continue to deliver updates efficiently. 

Please note that these changes are part of our ongoing efforts to improve our internal processes and won't have a direct impact on end-users.

## Other Updates

- We've also merged several pull requests that include minor improvements. These changes contribute to the overall stability and performance of our software.

We appreciate your continued support and feedback. Enjoy the new update!
